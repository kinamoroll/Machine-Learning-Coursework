# Machine-Learning-Coursework
An Introductory Machine Learning Online Course from Caltech.

This repository, maintained by kinamoroll, contains code solutions in the form of Jupyter notebooks for the homeworks and final of the Caltech introductory Machine Learning course [Learning from Data](https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html).

The course is taught by a renowned professor whose provided the following associated *course materials* and *video lectures*:

* [Lecture slides](https://work.caltech.edu/lectures.html)
* [Video lectures](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD63A284B7615313A)
* [Homework and Solution Keys](https://work.caltech.edu/homeworks.html)

The code in the notebooks might not be the most pythonic, but it works and the maintainer is still learning python programming. The primary focus at the moment is on learning machine learning theory, techniques and analysis, upheld by the challenging homework assignments.
